# 🏦 Customer Churn Prediction for Credit Card Services

## 📌 Problem Statement

A leading bank has identified a rising trend in customers leaving their credit card services. To proactively address this issue, the bank aims to build a predictive machine learning model to identify potential churners using customer data. The dataset contains records for 10,000 customers with features such as:

- Age  
- Salary  
- Marital Status  
- Credit Card Limit  
- Credit Card Category  
- And more...

## 🎯 Objectives

### 🔍 Churn Prediction
- Build a classification model to predict whether a customer is likely to churn.

### ⚙️ Model Selection
- Implement and evaluate:
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Address and analyze the imbalanced class distribution.

### 📊 Feature Importance
- Analyze which features are most influential in customer churn using model-specific and model-agnostic methods.

### 🤝 Proactive Intervention
- Identify high-risk customers.
- Propose business strategies and interventions to improve retention.
